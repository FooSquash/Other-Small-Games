# Battleground Card Game
The Battleground card game was designed as part of an assignment to modify an existing game. We chose to modify chess, and came up with a card-based version of chess where the moves of the board pieces are dictated by the cards drawn. Each player controls 5 pieces on the board which all are the same "piece" in theory, because they do not have any moves. Each player has a hand of 5 cards, however, that can be cast on a piece to make it perform that action. The gimmick with this game is that both players' hands are public information, meaning you can see your opponent's cards. This adds a level of complexity and planning to each movement, trying to mimic the idea that in chess, you know what your opponent's pieces can do. However, you do not know what card your enemy will draw on their next turn from the deck, so there is a level of randomness involved as well. We printed out the cards and board for this game, as you can see in the image below. More detailed rules can be found in the respective directory.

# Earth Resources Card Game
The Earth Resources card game is a turn-based resource-collection board game played by 2 - 4 players. In this game, each player controls a country with the objective of making sure that their country survives the longest while making sure that the planet itself does not perish. In an attempt to display the effects of countries and their impact on the planet, we made the win condition of this game represent that. One way to play is to work against other players and take all their resources, while another way to play is to work with other players to save the planet. Both options are viable, and both can lead to winning the game. We printed out the cards, resources, and more for this game, as seen below. More detailed rules and pictures can be found in the respective directory.

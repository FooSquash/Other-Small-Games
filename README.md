# Battleground Card Game
This game was designed as part of an assignment to modify an existing game. We chose to modify chess, and came up with a card-based version of chess where the moves of the board pieces are dictated by the cards drawn. Each player controls 5 pieces on the board which all are the same "piece" in theory, because they do not have any moves. Each player has a hand of 5 cards, however, that can be cast on a piece to make it perform that action. The gimmick with this game is that both players' hands are public information, meaning you can see your opponent's cards. This adds a level of complexity and planning to each movement, trying to mimic the idea that in chess, you know what your opponent's pieces can do. However, you do not know what card your enemy will draw on their next turn from the deck, so there is a level of randomness involved as well. We printed out the cards and board for this game, as you can see in the image below. More detailed rules can be found in the respective directory.
